## Confirm Correct Package Version
###

Confirm that you have the correct version of PPBDS.data installed by pressing "Run Code."

```{r confirm, exercise=TRUE}
packageVersion('PPBDS.data')
```

The answer should be ‘0.3.2.9007’, or a higher number. If it is not, you should upgrade your installation by issuing these commands:


```{r confirm-advice, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
remove.packages('PPBDS.data')  
library(remotes)  
remotes::install_github('davidkane9/PPBDS.data')  
```

Strictly speaking, it should not be necessary to remove a package. Just installing it again should overwrite the current version. But weird things sometimes happen, so removing first is the safest approach.

)
```

)
```


## Flipping a coin 
###

### Exercise 1

Let's make sure we understand the important vocabulary.

```{r coin1}
question_text("In a sentence, explain the difference between an empirical distrubtion and a posterior distribution.",
              answer(NULL, correct = TRUE), 
              incorrect = "Submitted.",
              message = "A posterior distribution is based on what you believe the distribution of some data will be, whereas an empiral distribution is the distribution of some actual data.")
```

### Exercise 2


```{r coin2}
question_text("How many times must you conduct the experiment to create a mathemetical distribution?",
              answer(NULL, correct = TRUE), 
              incorrect = "Submitted.",
              message = "A mathematical distribution requires no experimental data because it relies solely on mathematical formulas. Thus, you don't need to conduct the experiment at all before creating a mathematical distribution.")
```


### Exercise 3

Let's start by examining the standard, unweighted coin: i.e. $p_h = p_t = 0.5$. 

The function `rbinom()` is used to calculate a binomial distribution (when there are only two possible outcomes) Look at the following code to see how we can simulate a single coin flip. Try running the code multiple times---see if you can estimate approximately how many times you get each outcome.

```{r coin4, exercise = TRUE}
rbinom(n = 1, size = 1, prob = 0.5)
```

### Exercise 4

In the code chunk below, change our default `rbinom()` statement such that the number of *observations* (the `n` parameter) is equal to 100.

```{r coin5, exercise = TRUE}
rbinom(n = 1, size = 1, prob = 0.5)
```

### Exercise 5

This time, change the number of *trials* (the `size` parameter) to 100. See if you can figure out the difference between observations and trials in the `rbinom()` function.

```{r coin5_2, exercise = TRUE}
rbinom(n = 1, size = 1, prob = 0.5)
```



### Exercise 6

Use `tibble()` to create a new tibble. The tibble should have one column, `head`, equal to a binomial distribution with 100 observations of a fair coin (`prob = 0.5`) and 1 trial (i.e. 1 flip) per observation.

```{r coin6, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r coin6-hint, eval=FALSE}
tibble(head = rbinom(...))
```

### Exercise 7

Pipe your tibble into `ggplot()` to make a histogram using `geom_histrogram()`. Map `head` to the x-axis and set `binwidth` to .5.

```{r coin7, exercise = TRUE}

```


```{r coin7-hint, eval=FALSE}
tibble(head = rbinom(n = 100, size = 1, prob = 0.5)) %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = head)) +
    geom_histogram(binwidth = ...) +
```


### Exercise 8

We can use a `scale_x_continuous` function, along with the `breaks` and `labels` parameters, to reset the tick marks on the x-axis. Run the following code to see how to reset our graph's tick mark labels at x = 0 and x = 0.5.

```{r coin9, exercise = TRUE}
tibble(head = rbinom(n = 100, size = 1, prob = 0.5)) %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = head)) +
    geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.5) +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(0, 0.5), labels = c("Heads", "Random Label With No Bar"))
```


### Exercise 9

Use `scale_x_continuous()` like we did in the previous code chunk to reset the tick mark labels at x = 0 and x = 1 to "Heads" and "Tails."

```{r coin10, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 4}
tibble(head = rbinom(n = 100, size = 1, prob = 0.5)) %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = head)) +
    geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.5)
```

```{r coin10-hint, eval = FALSE}
tibble(head = rbinom(n = 100, size = 1, prob = 0.5)) %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = head)) +
    geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.5) +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = ..., labels = ...)
```


###

If we ran the code above 1,000 times, we'd probably get a result fairly close to 50 heads and 50 tails. However, sometimes (just from random chance), there would be significantly more heads than tails, or vice versa. But exactly how often would each unique distribution occur?


### Exercise 10

We're now going to make a different kind of empirical distribution. Start by using `tibble()` again to make a tibble. The sole column of the tibble should be `heads`, equal to the result of an `rbinom()` statement with 1,000 observations of a fair coin, 100 trials (flips) per observation, and .95 probability.

```{r coin12, exercise = TRUE}

```


```{r coin12-hint-2, eval = FALSE}
tibble(heads = ...)
```

### Exercise 11

Pipe your tibble into `ggplot()` to make a histogram with `heads` mapped to the x-axis. Set the binwidth` of the histogram to 1.

```{r coin13, exercise = TRUE}

```


Great work! This empirical distribution shows that while there is a significant amount of variance in the number of heads in 100 coin flips, nearly all of the observations have greater than 40 heads but less than 60 heads.



## Rolling two dice
###

Let's now look at the probability distributions of one or more dice rolls. We no longer can use `rbinom()` to make a binomial distribution because there are six outcomes, not two.

###

### Exercise 1
Recall from chapter 2 that we use the `sample()` function to generate random values. Run the code chunk below to see how we can generate ten random coin tosses using `sample()`. Remember to set `replace` equal to `TRUE` when you want a certain outcome (i.e. "heads" or "tails" in this case) to be achievable more than once.

```{r dice1, exercise = TRUE}
sample(x = c("heads", "tails"), size = 10, replace = TRUE)
```

### Exercise 2

Using `sample()`, simulate 10 dice rolls by setting the `x` argument to the vector of integers from 1 through 6. Note that you don't actually need to use the `c()` function in this case.

```{r dice2, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r dice2-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
sample(x = c(..., ...), size = 10, replace = TRUE)
```

```{r dice2-hint-2, eval = FALSE}
# 1:6 is equivalent to c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6).
```

### Exercise 3

Next, to make 10 simulations of the sum of *two* dice rolls, simply add together two of the `sample()` statements that you made in the last exercise.

```{r dice3, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r dice3-hint}
# Just add the sample statement from the previous exercise to itself.
```

### Exercise 4

Use `tibble()` to create a new tibble with one variable, `sum`, equal to the sum of the two `sample()` statements that you made in the last exercise. Remember to copy and paste your code from the previous exercise!

```{r dice4, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r dice4-hint, eval = FALSE}
tibble(sum = ...)
```

### Exercise 5

Add a `ggplot()` call, using a pipe, to create a histogram with `sum` mapped to the x-axis. Change `geom_histogram()`'s `binwidth` argument to 1 and its `color` argument to "white."

```{r dice5, exercise = TRUE}

```



## Normalized distributions

The y-axes of the graphs in this tutorial are slightly different than the y-axes of the graphs in the textbook. This is because the graphs in the textbook are *normalized*.

```{r normalize1}
question_text("In a sentence, explain the difference between normalized and unnormalized distributions.",
              answer(NULL, correct = TRUE), 
              incorrect = "Submitted.",
              message = "A normalized distribution will display the probability of each outcome on the y-axis, whereas an unnormalized distribution will display the count of the number of times that outcome occurs.")
```

### 

To make a normalized distribution, we'll need to manipulate the `count` variable of our histograms. Unfortunately, the `count` variable is created by ggplot2...not in our data set!

### 

### Exercise 1
To see why this is a problem, try running the following code, which attempts to make a histogram of dice rolls and then see how then see how the count for each roll differs from the average count. Then, continue onto the next exercise to see how we can fix the error.

```{r normalize2, exercise = TRUE, eval = FALSE, exercise.lines = 4}
tibble(roll = sample(x = 1:6, size = 20, replace = TRUE)) %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = roll, y = count / mean(count))) +
    geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, color = "white")
```

### Exercise 2

To tell R that `count` is not actually in our data set but is created by `geom_histogram()`, we need to surround the variable by two dots on each side (`..count..`). Use this technique to adjust the code below so that there is no error.

```{r normalize3, exercise = TRUE, eval = FALSE, exercise.lines = 4}
tibble(roll = sample(x = 1:6, size = 20, replace = TRUE)) %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = roll, y = count / mean(count))) +
    geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, color = "white")
```


### Exercise 3

Finally, copy and paste your code from the previous exercise. This time...divide each `count` by the `sum()` of the counts instead of the `mean()` of the counts.

```{r normalize4, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 4}

```

```{r normalize4-hint, eval = FALSE}
dice_roll <- tibble(roll = sample(x = 1:6, size = 20, replace = TRUE)) %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = roll, y = ...)) +
    geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, color = "white")
```

### Exercise 4

The code below makes the graph of the sum from rolling two dice 100 times. Notice how the graph currently shows counts, not probabilities, on the y-axis.

Use the technique from the previous exercise to normalize the distribution.

```{r normalize5, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 10}
tibble(sum = sample(x = 1:6, size = 100, replace = TRUE) +
                           sample(x = 1:6, size = 100, replace = TRUE)) %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = sum)) +
    geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, color = "white") +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = 2:12, labels = 2:12) +
    theme_classic() +
    labs(title = "Empirical Probability Distribution",
         subtitle = "Sum from Rolling Two Dice One Hundred Times",
         x = "Sum of Two Dice")
```

```{r normalize5-hint, eval = FALSE}
tibble(sum = sample(x = 1:6, size = 100, replace = TRUE) +
                           sample(x = 1:6, size = 100, replace = TRUE)) %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = sum, y = ...)) +
    geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, color = "white") +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = 2:12, labels = 2:12) +
    theme_classic() +
    labs(title = "Empirical Probability Distribution",
         subtitle = "Sum from Rolling Two Dice One Hundred Times",
         x = "Sum of Two Dice")
```




## Two models
### 

### Exercise 1

The classic example of two models is for disease testing. Suppose that 1% of a city with population 10,000 has a deadly disease. If you have the disease, the test will correctly diagnose you 99% of the time. If you don't have the disease, the test will correctly diagnose you 95% of the time. The question we want to answer is: _What is the probability that you have the disease, given that you test positive_?

Call an `rbinom()` statement with 10,000 observations, 1 trial per observation, and `prob` equal to 0.01. This will make a vector of length 10,000 such that every person infected by the disease (probability 0.01) is represented by the number 1, and every person not infected is represented by the number 0.

```{r twomodels1, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r twomodels1-hint-1}
# Remember that n is the number of observations and size is the number of trials per observation.
```

```{r twomodels1-hint-2, eval = FALSE}
rbinom(n = ..., size = ..., prob = ...)
```

### Exercise 2

Using `tibble()`, create a tibble with one column, `has_disease`. `has_disease` should be equal to the result of the `rbinom()` statement from the previous exercise.

```{r twomodels2, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r twomodels2-hint, eval = FALSE}
tibble(...)
```

### Exercise 3

Copy and paste your answer from above. Start a pipe and `mutate()` a new variable, `test_positive`. `test_positive` should be equal the result of an `if_else()` statement with the condition being that `has_disease` is equal to 1. For now, if the condition is true, set `test_positive` to 1, but if the condition is false, set `test_positive` to 0.

```{r twomodels3, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r twomodels3-hint, eval = FALSE}
tibble(has_disease = rbinom(n = 10000, size = 1, prob = 0.01)) %>%
  mutate(test_positive = if_else(...,
                                 true = 1,
                                 false = 0))
```

### Exercise 4

According to our current model, every person who has the disease automatically tests positive, and vice versa. To add the possibility of a false positive or false negative, we need to add two more `rbinom()` statements inside our `if_else()` statement.

Use the model I gave you in the `true` case to add an `rbinom()` statement to the `false` case. The `rbinom()` statement should have 10,000 observations, 1 trial per observation, and a probability of testing positive equal to 0.05 (since the test correctly diagnoses a negative result for an uninfected person 95% of the time).

```{r twomodels4, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 5}
tibble(has_disease = rbinom(n = 10000, size = 1, prob = 0.01)) %>%
  mutate(test_positive = if_else(condition = has_disease == 1,
                                 true = rbinom(n = 10000, size = 1, prob = 0.99),
                                 false = 0L))
```

```{r twomodels4-hint, eval = FALSE}
tibble(has_disease = rbinom(n = 10000, size = 1, prob = 0.01)) %>%
  mutate(test_positive = if_else(condition = has_disease == 1,
                                 true = rbinom(n = 10000, size = 1, prob = 0.99),
                                 false = rbinom(...)))
```



### Exercise 5
Awesome work! We now have a tibble that uses randomness to create a model of our disease.

Use the assignment operator (`<-`) to save the tibble from the previous exercise to `disease_testing`.

```{r twomodels5, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 5}

```

### Exercise 6

Add a `ggplot()` call to make a jittered scatterplot that takes in `disease_testing` as its data, maps `test_positive` to the x-axis, and maps `has_disease` to the y-axis.

```{r twomodels6, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 5}
disease_testing <- tibble(has_disease = rbinom(n = 10000, size = 1, prob = 0.01)) %>%
  mutate(test_positive = if_else(condition = has_disease == 1,
                                 true = rbinom(n = 10000, size = 1, prob = 0.99),
                                 false = rbinom(n = 10000, size = 1, prob = 0.05)))
```

```{r twomodels6-hint, eval = FALSE}
disease_testing <- tibble(has_disease = rbinom(n = 10000, size = 1, prob = 0.01)) %>%
  mutate(test_positive = if_else(condition = has_disease == 1,
                                 true = rbinom(n = 10000, size = 1, prob = 0.99),
                                 false = rbinom(n = 10000, size = 1, prob = 0.05)))

ggplot(...) +
  ...
```


### Exercise 7

This empirical distribution graph makes it pretty clear that you are more likely *not* to have the disease even if you test positive. However, it's hard to tell exactly *how* much likelier. For that, we're going to need a histogram.

Start by making a new pipe with `disease_testing` and `filter()` the pipe to just the rows such that `test_positive` is equal to 1.

```{r twomodels9, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 7}
disease_testing <- tibble(has_disease = rbinom(n = 10000, size = 1, prob = 0.01)) %>%
  mutate(test_positive = if_else(condition = has_disease == 1,
                                 true = rbinom(n = 10000, size = 1, prob = 0.99),
                                 false = rbinom(n = 10000, size = 1, prob = 0.05)))

disease_testing
```

```{r twomodels9-hint, eval = FALSE}
disease_testing <- tibble(has_disease = rbinom(n = 10000, size = 1, prob = 0.01)) %>%
  mutate(test_positive = if_else(condition = has_disease == 1,
                                 true = rbinom(n = 10000, size = 1, prob = 0.99),
                                 false = rbinom(n = 10000, size = 1, prob = 0.05)))

disease_testing %>%
  ...
```

### Exercise 8

Add a `ggplot()` call to the pipe to make a histogram that maps the `has_disease` variable to the x-axis. Also, set the `binwidth` of the histogram to 0.5.

```{r twomodels10, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 8}

```


### Exercise 9

Use `scale_x_continuous()` just like we did in the joint distribution graph to reset the tick mark labels on the x-axis. Again, we want the `breaks` to be 0 and 1 and the `labels` to be "Negative" and "Positive."

```{r twomodels12, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 10}

```

### Exercise 10

Next, use the same two-dot technique that we used in the previous section to normalize the distribution (we want to divide the `count` of each bar by the `sum()` of the counts of all the bars).

```{r twomodels13, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 11}

```

```{r twomodels13-hint-1}
# Remember to replace "count" with "..count.." whenever you use it.
```

```{r twomodels13-hint-2, eval = FALSE}
disease_testing %>%
  filter(test_positive == 1) %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = has_disease, y = ...)) +
    geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.5) +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = 0:1, labels = c("Negative", "Positive"))
```


###

Great work! From this graph, we can see that you have between an 80% and 85% chance of *not* having the disease, even after you test positive.
