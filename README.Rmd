## About this package

`PPBDS.data` provides the data and the tutorials used in *[Preceptor's Primer for Bayesian Data Science](https://davidkane9.github.io/PPBDS/)*, the textbook used in [Gov 50: Data](https://www.davidkane.info/files/gov_50_fall_2020.html) at Harvard University. 

<!-- unsure if badges are available for use yet here -->

## Installation

As this package is not released on CRAN, you must install it directly from GitHub.

```r
remotes::install_github("davidkane9/PPBDS.data")
```

## Loading Preceptor's Data

After installing the package, it loads as any package should.

```{r loading, message=F}
library(tidyverse) 
library(PPBDS.data)

qscores
```

## Using the data

Once the library is loaded and you have confirmed that it can be accessed in your local environment, the data sets can be called as objects and used like any other data you would otherwise read in and assign to an object manually. See the following example of a plot using `PPBDS.data::qscores`. 

```{r quick.plot, eval=FALSE}

library(ggplot2)

qscores %>% 
  filter(department == "GOV") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(hours, rating, color = term)) +
    geom_point(aes(size = enrollment), alpha = 0.4) +
    geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ x, se = FALSE) +
    facet_wrap(~term) +
    labs(
      title = "Student Course Evaluations at Harvard",
      subtitle = "Department of Government",
      caption = "Data provided by Aurash Vatan '23",
      x = "Weekly workload, hours",
      y = "Rating, 1 (worst) to 5 (best)",
      size = "Enrollment") +
    theme_linedraw() +
    theme(
        text = element_text(family = "Palatino"),
        axis.text.x = element_text(size = 10),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 10)) +
    scale_color_discrete(guide = "none")
```

<!-- DK: We need some comments explaining what this is doing and how we can replace it. Specifically, why place the figure in man/ rather than inst/? -->
